# A DALL-E 3 Python Native Plugin for Semantic Kernel v1.0.1

This plugin uses the OpenAI Python API to submit a prompt to the DALL-E 3 model and return the resulting URL.

To use this plugin, you must have an OpenAI API key.

## Setting up the configuration key

This project uses `python-dotenv` to manage configuration files. To set up the configuration file, you need to have a `.env` file in the root of the project with the following contents:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY="<your api key>"
```

## Required packages

The source code includes a `requirements.txt` file that lists the required packages. You can install them with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. You can also simply install the `semantic-kernel` and the `python-dotenv` packages and they'll bring in the rest of the dependencies.

## Calling the plugin with Semantic Kernel 1.0.1

Using the plugin is straightforward. With the plugin in your code directory, you can call it like this:

```python
import asyncio
import semantic_kernel as sk
from Plugins import Dalle3

async def main():
    kernel = sk.Kernel()
    animal_str = "A painting of a cat sitting in a sofa in the impressionist style"
    dalle3 = kernel.import_skill(Dalle3())

    animal_pic_url = await kernel.run_async(
        dalle3['ImageFromPrompt'],
        input_str=animal_str
    )
    print(animal_pic_url)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```
The plugin will return a URL to the image generated by DALL-E 3.
